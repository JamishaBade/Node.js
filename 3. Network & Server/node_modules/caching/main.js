const a =require("./myFileModule")
const b=require("./myFileModule")

a.increment() // eventho we incremented the counter in object a 
console.log(b.get()) // since b is also refering to the same object, the value is also incremented here. so, it prints 1 instead of 0. This is the concept of caching



// Caching: Caching is basically a technique used to store copies of data in a location that's quicker to access, so that when you need that data again, it can be retrieved much faster than fetching it from the original source.
