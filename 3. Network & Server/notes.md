# Domain Name Entry

- user types the domain name into the browser (e.g. www.example.com)
- DNS query: Browers sends the domain to the DNS query. This resolves the domain into the IP address.
- DNS Server: Provides the correct IP address for the domain.
- Browser connect: the browser uses the IP address to connect to the webserver.

# 3 types of DNS servers.

1. Root DNS - passes the url for TLD (Generic || country domain)
2. TLD DNS -passes to the authoritative DNS
3. Authoritative DNS- takes the domain name and ressolves to the corresponding IP adress.

Finally, the browers searches the IP address in the internet and connects it.
